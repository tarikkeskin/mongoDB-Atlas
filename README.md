Video Game Distribution Service with usingMongoDB Realm 

• There is 4 main pages: **Home Page, User Page, Games Page and Single-Game Page**

• Home Page is the start page which will be accessed through index.html. 
- There should be at least 7 actions that can be applied on this page: Add Game, Remove Game,
Disable Rating and Comment, Enable Rating and Comment, Add User, Remove User and Login as a User.
- Add Game creates an entry of a game with these 6 required attributes (+2 optional ones): Name, Genre(s), Photo (No need to implement a way to upload, photo attribute can be initialized with a link to an online image). Game initially has no Play Time, Rating and All Comments and it is initially enabled to be rated and commented on. For the optional attributes, it should be free to choose what to add. (i.e. they can be blank, the release date, PC requirements, developer name, some advertisement quotes or else. There should be no limit on what to add thanks to NoSQL)
- Remove Game deletes the game and all of it’s Play Time, Rating and Comments. (The user’s total play time attribute will not be affected but the other attributes such as Most Played Game, Average of Ratings or Comments on user pages should be updated).
- Disable Rating and Comment disables rating and commenting option for a game. Old ratings and comments are not deleted. It can still be played but it can not be rated or commented on unless an enable operation is called afterwards.
- Enable Rating and Comment enables rating and commenting option for the game. It can be played, rated and commented on.
- Add User creates an entry of a user with a Name attribute. (User initially has no Total Play Time, Average of Ratings, Most Played Game and Comments).
- Remove User deletes an entry of a user and all of it’s attributes. When you delete a user, all of the affects of it’s actions are also deleted. This means that the games that the user played, rated and commented before are also affected. (i.e. remove the user’s comments from All Comments, subtract the user’s play time from Play Time of games, and calculate Rating of the Game without the deleted user’s rating)
- Login as a User navigates through the homepage of the selected user as him or her. (Note that you don’t need to implement passwords or any kind of protection).
- Note that in order to execute Remove, Disable, Enable, Login actions you need to implement a way to access the relevant Games and Users. (i.e. You may use dropdown lists, or they can be written manually by looking at a dynamically updated table that is also available on Home Page).
- User Page shows 5 different elements: User Name, Average of Ratings, Total Play Time, Most Played Game and Comments. Average of Ratings is the mean of all ratings given by the user. (For this attribute play time does not have any effect). Total Play Time is the sum of play times of this user on all games. Most Played Game is the game that the user played the most. It is not important which one is shown in case of equality. Comments are the comments of the user given on different games. The order of the comments is done by the user’s own play time on the games that are commented. (Game names are also shown with the comments)
- Rate Game rates a game with an integer point between 1 and 5. When a game is rated, Average of Ratings of User Page and Rating of the Game on Games Page are updated. (Rating of the Game is an attribute of Games Page determined by (∑(𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒 ∗ 𝑈𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑅𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 )/𝑃𝑙𝑎𝑦𝑇𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑂𝑓𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑒 , i.e. each user contributes to the average of a game with respect to their play time on the same game). If a user rates a game more than once, the old value is updated (i.e. old rating is overwritten by the new one).
- Play Game increments the Total Play Time of the user by the given value. It also updates Rating of the Game on Games Page. After this action is executed, the order of the Comments on this page and the order of the All Comments attribute on the Games Page may also change according to the new play time values. Most Played Game attribute should also be checked for update after this operation.
- Comment on a Game adds a comment of a game on the Comments attribute. For this action to be executed there is also a prerequisite that the user played this game before (i.e. at least 1 hour of play time). Users can not comment on the games that they did not play. This action also updates All Comments element on the Games Page. If a user comments on a game more than once, the old value is updated (i.e. old comment is overwritten by the new one).
- Look Games navigates to the Games Page.
